# stream-editor

An interactive web UI for building and debugging Linux text stream editing commands like sed, grep, and awk.

Idea: Linux text manipulations are really powerful for pattern extraction and data formatting, but the shell can be a diffcult interface for tinkering with them and inspecting the output as you pipe it from one command to another.

Stream Editor tries to solve this with a pretty web UI that lets you inspect your input and output at each step of the way with an optional GitHub-style visual diff of changes after each command.
